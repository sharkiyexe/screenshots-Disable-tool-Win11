# Screen Disable tool
## I made it so you don't have to download a whole app just to turn off/Change screenshot shortcut. 

before you use the tool make sure u download XShare (https://getsharex.com/)[XShare] and change the hotkey to win+shift+S :3

click download to download the .bat. I made 2 incase if u changed ur mind and wanna turn on back the screenshot tool. if windows updated something and broke the tool. and you wanna fix the coding. pls send me a dm in my (https://x.com/sharkiy_exe_)[twitter] am not good with looking over my gmail.

thank you for downloading it.
